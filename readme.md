[IAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) stands for Identity and Access Management. It is a complex domain which covers **user accounts, authentication, authorization, roles, permissions and privacy**. It is an essential pillar of the cloud stack, where users, products and security meets. The [other pillar being billing & payments üí∞](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-billing/).

This curated [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list expose all the technologies, protocols and jargon of the domain in a comprehensive and actionable manner.

## Overview

<img align="right" width="50%" src="./assets/cloud-software-stack-iam.jpg"/>

In a Stanford class providing an [overview of cloud computing](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs349d/docs/L01_overview.pdf), the software architecture of the platform is described as in the right diagram ‚Üí

Here we set out the big picture: definition and strategic importance of the domain, its place in the larger ecosystem, plus some critical features.

- [The EnterpriseReady SaaS Feature Guides](https://www.enterpriseready.io) - The majority of the features making B2B users happy will be implemented by the IAM perimeter.

- [IAM is hard. It's really hard.](https://twitter.com/kmcquade3/status/1291801858676228098) - ‚ÄúOverly permissive AWS IAM policies that allowed `s3:GetObject` to `*` (all) resources‚Äù, led to \$80 million fine for Capital One. The only reason why you can't overlook IAM as a business owner.

- [IAM Is The Real Cloud Lock-In](https://forrestbrazeal.com/2019/02/18/cloud-irregular-iam-is-the-real-cloud-lock-in/) - A little *click-baity*, but author admit that ‚ÄúIt depends on how much you trust them to 1. Stay in business; 2. Not jack up your prices; 3. Not deprecate services out from under you; 4. Provide more value to you in business acceleration than they take away in flexibility.‚Äù

## Security

Security is one of the most central pillar of IAM foundations. Here are some broad concepts.

- [Enterprise Information Security](https://infosec.mozilla.org) - Mozilla's security and access guidelines.

- [Mitigating Cloud Vulnerabilities](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/22/2002237484/-1/-1/0/CSI-MITIGATING-CLOUD-VULNERABILITIES_20200121.PDF) - ‚ÄúThis document divides cloud vulnerabilities into four classes (misconfiguration, poor access control, shared tenancy vulnerabilities, and supply chain vulnerabilities)‚Äù.

- [Cartography](https://github.com/lyft/cartography) - A Neo4J-based tool to map out dependencies and relationships between services and resources. Supports AWS, GCP, GSuite, Okta and GitHub.

- [Open guide to AWS Security and IAM](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws#security-and-iam)

## Account Management

The foundation of IAM: the definition and life-cycle of users, groups, roles and permissions.

- [As a user, I want‚Ä¶](https://mobile.twitter.com/oktopushup/status/1030457418206068736) - A meta-critic of account management, in which features expected by the business clash with real user needs, in the form of user stories written by a fictional project manager.

- [Things end users care about but programmers don't](https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/things-end-users-care-about-but-programmers-dont/) - In the same spirit as above, but broader: all the little things we overlook as developers but users really care about. In the top of that list lies account-centric features, diverse integration and import/export tools. I.e. all the enterprise customers needs to cover.

- [Separate the account, user and login/auth details](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21151830) - Sound advice to lay down the foundation of a future-proof IAM API.

- [Identity Beyond Usernames](https://lord.io/blog/2020/usernames/) - On the concept of usernames as identifiers, and the complexities introduced when unicode characters meets uniqueness requirements.

- [Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) - User login, user registration, 2FA and profile management.

- [Conjur](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur) - Automatically secures secrets used by privileged users and machine identities.

- [SuperTokens](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core) - Open-source project for login and session management which supports passwordless, social login, email and phone logins.

- [UserFrosting](https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting) - Modern PHP user login and management framework.

## Cryptography

The whole authentication stack is based on cryptography primitives. This can't be overlooked.

- [Cryptographic Right Answers](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html) - An up to date set of recommendations for developers who are not cryptography engineers. There's even a [shorter summary](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16749140) available.

- [Real World Crypto Symposium](https://rwc.iacr.org) - Aims to bring together cryptography researchers with developers, focusing on uses in real-world environments such as the Internet, the cloud, and embedded devices.

- [An Overview of Cryptography](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html) - ‚ÄúThis paper has two major purposes. The first is to define some of the terms and concepts behind basic cryptographic methods, and to offer a way to compare the myriad cryptographic schemes in use today. The second is to provide some real examples of cryptography in use today.‚Äù

- [Papers we love: Cryptography](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/cryptography/README.md) - Foundational papers of cryptography.

- [Lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions](http://valerieaurora.org/hash.html) - ‚ÄúIf you are using compare-by-hash to generate addresses for data that can be supplied by malicious users, you should have a plan to migrate to a new hash every few years‚Äù.

### Identifiers

Tokens, primary keys, UUIDs, ‚Ä¶ Whatever the end use, you'll have to generate these numbers with some randomness and uniqueness properties.

- [Security Recommendations for Any Device that Depends on Randomly-Generated Numbers](https://www.av8n.com/computer/htm/secure-random.htm) - ‚ÄúThe phrase ‚Äòrandom number generator‚Äô should be parsed as follows: It is a random generator of numbers. It is not a generator of random numbers.‚Äù

- [RFC #4122: UUID - Security Considerations](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-6) - ‚ÄúDo not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants access)‚Äù. UUIDs are designed to be unique, not to be random or unpredictable: do not use UUIDs as a secret.

- [Awesome Identifiers](https://adileo.github.io/awesome-identifiers/) - A benchmark of all identifier formats.

- [Awesome GUID](https://github.com/secretGeek/AwesomeGUID) - Funny take on the global aspect of unique identifiers.

## Zero-trust Network

Zero trust network security operates under the principle ‚Äúnever trust, always verify‚Äù.

- [What is BeyondCorp? What is Identity-Aware Proxy?](https://medium.com/google-cloud/what-is-beyondcorp-what-is-identity-aware-proxy-de525d9b3f90) - More companies add extra layers of VPNs, firewalls, restrictions and constraints, resulting in a terrible experience and a slight security gain. There's a better way.

- [oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) - Identity & Access Proxy and Access Control Decision API that authenticates, authorizes, and mutates incoming HTTP requests. Inspired by the BeyondCorp / Zero Trust white paper.

- [Practical Recommendations for Stronger, More Usable Passwords](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/publications/Tan-CCS20.pdf) - This study recommend the association of: blocklist checks against commonly leaked passwords, password policies without character-class requirements, minimum-strength policies.

- [Banks, Arbitrary Password Restrictions and Why They Don't Matter](https://www.troyhunt.com/banks-arbitrary-password-restrictions-and-why-they-dont-matter/) - ‚ÄúArbitrary low limits on length and character composition are bad.

Mechanisms based on designated trustees and personal knowledge questions, on the other hand, fall short, both in terms of convenience and efficiency.‚Äù

- [Secrets, Lies, and Account Recovery: Lessons from the Use of Personal Knowledge Questions at Google](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43783.pdf) - ‚ÄúOur analysis confirms that secret questions generally offer a security level that is far lower than user-chosen passwords. (‚Ä¶) Surprisingly, we found that a significant cause of this insecurity is that users often don't answer truthfully. (‚Ä¶) On the usability side, we show that secret answers have surprisingly poor memorability‚Äù.

- [How effective is basic account hygiene at preventing hijacking](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html) - Google security team's data shows 2FA blocks 100% of automated bot hacks.

- [Introduction to JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/) - Get up to speed on JWT with this article.

- [Learn how to use JWT for Authentication](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens) - Learn how to use JWT to secure your web app.

- [Using JSON Web Tokens as API Keys](https://auth0.com/blog/using-json-web-tokens-as-api-keys/) - Compared to API keys, JWTs offers granular security, homogenous auth architecture, decentralized issuance, OAuth2 compliance, debuggability, expiration control, device management.

- [Managing a Secure JSON Web Token Implementation](https://cursorblog.com/managing-a-secure-json-web-token-implementation/) - JWT has all sorts of flexibility that make it hard to use well.

### OAuth2 & OpenID

[OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0) is a *delegated authorization* framework. [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) is an *authentication* layer on top of it.

The old *OpenID* is dead; the new *OpenID Connect* is very much not-dead.

- [The problem with OAuth for Authentication](http://www.thread-safe.com/2012/01/problem-with-oauth-for-authentication.html) - ‚ÄúThe problem is that OAuth 2.0 is a Delegated Authorization protocol, and not a Authentication protocol.‚Äù 10 years after, this article is still the best explanation on [why use OpenID Connect instead of plain OAuth2](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/260519)?

### SAML

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to exchange authorization and authentication between services, like OAuth/OpenID protocols above.

Typical SAML identity provider is an institution or a big corporation's internal SSO, while the typical OIDC/OAuth provider is a tech company that runs a data silo.

- [SAML vs. OAuth](https://web.archive.org/web/20230327071347/https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-oauth/) - ‚ÄúOAuth is a protocol for authorization: it ensures Bob goes to the right parking lot. In contrast, SAML is a protocol for authentication, or allowing Bob to get past the guardhouse.‚Äù

- [The Difference Between SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0](https://www.ubisecure.com/uncategorized/difference-between-saml-and-oauth/) - ‚ÄúEven though SAML was actually designed to be widely applicable, its contemporary usage is typically shifted towards enterprise SSO scenarios. On the other hand, OAuth was designed for use with applications on the Internet, especially for delegated authorisation.‚Äù

- [What's the Difference Between OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML?](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/whats-the-difference-between-oauth-openid-connect-and-saml/) - Identity is hard. Another take on the different protocol is always welcome to help makes sense of it all.

## Authorization

Now we know you are you. But are you allowed to do what you want to do?

Policy specification is the science, enforcement is the art.

### Policy models

As a concept, access control policies can be designed to follow very different archetypes, from classic [Access Control Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list) to [Role Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control). In this section we explore lots of different patterns and architectures.

- [Why Authorization is Hard](https://www.osohq.com/post/why-authorization-is-hard) - Because it needs multiple tradeoffs on Enforcement which is required in so many places, on Decision architecture to split business logic from authorization logic, and on Modeling to balance power and complexity.

- [The never-ending product requirements of user authorization](https://alexolivier.me/posts/the-never-ending-product-requirements-of-user-authorization) - How a simple authorization model based on roles is not enough and gets complicated fast due to product packaging, data locality, enterprise organizations and compliance.

- [RBAC like it was meant to be](https://tailscale.com/blog/rbac-like-it-was-meant-to-be/) - How we got from DAC (unix permissions, secret URL), to MAC (DRM, MFA, 2FA, SELinux), to RBAC. Details how the latter allows for better modeling of policies, ACLs, users and groups.

- [The Case for Granular Permissions](https://cerbos.dev/blog/the-case-for-granular-permissions) - Discuss the limitations of RBAC and how ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) addresses them.

- [In Search For a Perfect Access Control System](https://goteleport.com/blog/access-controls/) - The historical origins of authorization schemes. Hints at the future of sharing, trust and delegation between different teams and organizations.

- [AWS IAM Roles, a tale of unnecessary complexity](https://infosec.rodeo/posts/thoughts-on-aws-iam/) - The history of fast-growing AWS explains how the current sheme came to be, and how it compares to GCP's resource hierarchy.

- [Semantic-based Automated Reasoning for AWS Access Policies using SMT](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Security/pdfs/Semantic_Based_Automated_Reasoning_for_AWS_Access_Policies_Using_SMT.pdf) - Zelkova is how AWS does it. This system perform symbolic analysis of IAM policies, and solve the reachability of resources according user's rights and access constraints. Also see the higher-level [introduction given at re:inforce 2019](https://youtu.be/x6wsTFnU3eY?t=2111).

- [Zanzibar: Google's Consistent, Global Authorization System](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48190) - Scales to trillions of access control lists and millions of authorization requests per second to support services used by billions of people. It has maintained 95th-percentile latency of less than 10 milliseconds and availability of greater than 99.999% over 3 years of production use. [Other bits not in the paper](https://twitter.com/LeaKissner/status/1136626971566149633). [Zanzibar Academy](https://zanzibar.academy/) is a site dedicated to explaining how Zanzibar works.

- [Oso](https://github.com/osohq/oso) - A batteries-included library for building authorization in your application.

- [Cerbos](https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos) - An authorization endpoint to write context-aware access control policies.

### AWS policy tools

Tools and resources exclusively targetting the [AWS IAM policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) ecosystem.

- [Become an AWS IAM Policy Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7-fAT3z8Lo) - ‚ÄúIn my nearly 5 years at Amazon, I carve out a little time each day, each week to look through the forums, customer tickets to try to find out where people are having trouble.‚Äù

Reports on policies that violate security best practices or contain errors. Supports both identity-based and resource-based policies.

### Macaroons

A clever curiosity to distribute and delegate authorization.

- [Google's Macaroons in Five Minutes or Less](https://blog.bren2010.io/blog/googles-macaroons) - If I'm given a Macaroon that authorizes me to perform some action(s) under certain restrictions, I can non-interactively build a second Macaroon with stricter restrictions that I can then give to you.

- [Macaroons: Cookies with Contextual Caveats for Decentralized Authorization in the Cloud](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub41892) - Google's original paper.

- [Google paper's author compares Macaroons and JWTs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14294463) - As a consumer/verifier of macaroons, they allow you (through third-party caveats) to defer some authorization decisions to someone else. JWTs don't.

## Trust & Safety

Once you've got a significant user base, it is called a community. You'll then be responsible to protect it: the customer, people, the company, the business, and facilitate all interactions and transactions happening therein.

A critical intermediation complex driven by a policy and constraint by local laws, the Trust & Safety department is likely embodied by a cross-functional team of 24/7 operators and systems of highly advanced moderation and administration tools. You can see it as an extension of customer support services, specialized in edge-cases like manual identity checks, moderation of harmful content, stopping harassment, handling of warrants and copyright claims, data sequestration and other credit card disputes.

### User Identity

Most businesses do not collect customer's identity to create user profiles to sell to third party, no. But you still have to: local laws require to keep track of contract relationships under the large [Know You Customer (KYC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) banner.

- [The Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf) - Is this paper aims at identity metasystem, its laws still provides great insights at smaller scale, especially the first law: to always allow user control and ask for consent to earn trust.

## Privacy

As the guardian of user's data, the IAM stack is deeply bounded by the respect of privacy.

### Anonymization

As a central repository of user data, the IAM stack stakeholders have to prevent any leakage of business and customer data. To allow for internal analytics, anonymization is required.

- [The False Allure of Hashing for Anonymization](https://gravitational.com/blog/hashing-for-anonymization/) - Hashing is not sufficient for anonymization no. But still it is good enough for pseudonymization (which is allowed by the GDPR).

## UX/UI

As stakeholder of the IAM stack, you're going to implement in the backend the majority of the primitives required to build-up the sign-up tunnel and user onboarding. This is the first impression customers will get from your product, and can't be overlooked: you'll have to carefully design it with front-end experts. Here is a couple of guides to help you polish that experience.
